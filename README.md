This is a simple yet elegant Profile Card built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It highlights my frontend skills and showcases an interactive user interface.

> The card displays:
- My profile picture
- LinkedIn and GitHub buttons with direct links
- An About Me section introducing who I am
- A "Show Hobbies" button that reveals my hobbies with smooth toggle animation

The goal of this project was to practice structuring content, designing clean layouts with CSS, and adding interactivity through JavaScript. The toggle effect for hobbies was implemented to demonstrate basic DOM manipulation and smooth transitions.
This project reflects my journey into frontend development and my enthusiasm for creating user-friendly interfaces.
